Sam is a multi-purpose desktop widget.  

-It is ultimately meant to run as a daemon, 
and to become active on special keystroke.
	+ Right now it is only command-line.  Need to run in the BG
	and listen for key-combination

-Right now Sam is designed to run on OSX, and certain features 
will fail in other environments.
	+ Need to add support for other environments

-Sam attempts to parse and interpret the input, and to match
it against rules in a dictionary
	
-Rules are mini-classes, designated by keywords.  If one of those keywords matches,
the rule fires, and the action method for that rule class is executed.
	+ Need to add more rules
